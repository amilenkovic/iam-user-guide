## Actions Defined by Single Sign\-On<a name="singlesign-on-actions-as-permissions"></a>

You can specify the following actions in the `Action` element of an IAM policy statement\. By using policies, you define the permissions for anyone performing an operation in AWS\. When you use an action in a policy, you usually allow or deny access to the API operation or CLI command with the same name\. However, in some cases, a single action controls access to more than one operation\. Alternatively, some operations require several different actions\. For details about the columns in the following table, see [The Actions Table](reference_policies_actions-resources-contextkeys.md#actions_table)\.

## Resources Defined by SSO<a name="singlesign-on-resources-for-iam-policies"></a>

SSO has no service\-defined resources that can be used as the `Resource` element of an IAM policy statement\.

## Condition Keys for Single Sign\-On<a name="singlesign-on-policy-keys"></a>

SSO has no service\-specific context keys that can be used in the `Condition` element of policy statements\. For the list of the global context keys that are available to all services, see [Available Keys for Conditions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html#AvailableKeys) in the *IAM Policy Reference*\.
